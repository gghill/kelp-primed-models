## Assessing the impact of epigenetic priming for increased thermal tolerance on the modeled global distribution of economically important kelps via Species Distribution Models (SDMs)
*Incorporating stress tolerance results from physiological mariculture trials into species distribution models for kelp in a changing climate*

GH & CG 

Modeling pipeline consists of:

1. Occurrence data import and cleaning
2. Modeling area delineation via presence buffer and country buffer (currently 200km)
3. Environmental data import and modification for primed treatment
4. Gridding of occurrence records to environmental data resolution
5. Modeling and predicting using MaxEnt
6. Compare outputs from primed and non-primed models
7. Project primed and unprimed models into future climate scenarios and compare again
